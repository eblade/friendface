Introduction

This is an experiment with peer-to-peer communication. The idea is to create a
possibility to be anonymous while still keeping the possibility of
verification for those considered trusted. The keys to achieve this are:

- No central server.

- Asymmetric signing with unique keys per message. Author saves private key to
  prove authenticity if wanted.

- Hand-shaking for establishing trust, including a global key.
